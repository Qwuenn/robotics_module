    <h1>Designs of Sumo Bot</h1>
    <p>
        The Sumo Bots have three designs to have uniqueness between each other, for visual representation as well as for the
        compatibility with the preferred fighting style.

    <p>
        The design is solely focusing on speed and using a high gear ratio (large gear turning a small gear) to surprise an
        enemy with a fast attack. It can maneuver the dohyo with ease and it can also confuse slow-moving enemy. But due to low
        pushing power, it canâ€™t win a face-to-face pushing and it can be easily overwhelmed.

    <h5 id="design-based-on-power-(bruce)" class="mb-4">Design Based on Power (Bruce)</h5>
    <p>
        Using a low gear ratio (small gear turning a large gear), this design uses its high power output to push enemies out of
        the dohyo. It can withstand a long time in pushing each other compared to the design based on speed. But due to its
        power being diverted to pushing than speed, it is a slow-moving Sumo Bot and it is vulnerable to surprise and fast
        attack.

    <p>
        The design incorporates both speed and power into the Sumo Bot and uses a medium gear ratio to balance out the elements.
        This is ideal for those who love to have a match with flexibility.
