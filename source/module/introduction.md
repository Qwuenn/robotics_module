# **Introduction** {#introduction}

##### Discusses the concept of Robotics that can be assembled by kids with no computer programming required.

### What is Robotics? {#what-is-robotics}

Robotics is a discipline that combines computer science and engineering. It is the study of how to plan, create, operate, and use robots. Its objective is to develop robots that can assist and help humans in making their lives easier.

Robotics is the study of creating robots that can take the place of humans and mimic their behavior. It can be used in a variety of circumstances and for a variety of uses, but often are currently used in hazardous environments, production facilities, or in situations where humans are unable to survive. It is also often designed to mimic humans. This is said to assist of a robot's acceptance in such replicative actions that are normally done by humans. Driving, carrying, speaking, cognition, and some other human behaviour are all performed by these robots.

### Types of Robots {#types-of-robots}

Robots come in all shape and sizes to efficiently do their task, it depends on their design. Generally, there are five types of robots:

###### **Pre-programmed Robots** {#pre-programmed-robots} 
Pre-programmed robots perform basic, monotonous tasks in a regulated environment. The arm performs one purpose — welding a door on, inserting a certain component into the motor, etc. — and its role is to do it longer, quicker, and more reliably than a person.

###### **Humanoid Robots** {#humanoid-robots} 
Humanoid robots are machines that resemble and/or imitate human behavior. These robots often perform human-like tasks (such as running, jumping, and holding objects) and are often programmed to resemble humans, including human faces and gestures.

###### **Autonomous Robots** {#autonomous-robots}
Human operators are not needed for autonomous robots to work. This robots are typically designed to perform tasks in open environments without the need for human supervision. They are very special because they use sensors to sense their surroundings and then use decision-making systems (usually a computer) to take the best next action based on their data and goal.

###### **Teleoperated Robots** {#teleoperated-robots}
Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable remote human control. These robots are typically used in harsh geographical environments, temperatures, and circumstances.

###### **Augmenting Robots** {#augmenting-robots}
Augmenting robotics either develop on actual human skills or supplement those that have been disabled. The world of robotics for human augmentation is one in which science fiction could become reality quite quickly, with bots capable of redefining civilization and making humans faster and stronger.

### Uses of Robots {#uses-of-robots}

Robots have a wider range of applications, making them an ideal technology for the future. We will now see robotics almost everywhere. We'll see them in hospitals, hotels, and also on the roads.

###### **Manufacturing** {#manufacturing}
The manufacturing industry is most definitely the oldest and most well-known use of robotics. These robots and co-bots (bots that operate alongside humans) test and assemble objects such as vehicles and industrial machinery. More than three million industrial robots are currently in use, according to reports.

###### **Logistics** {#logistics} 
Shipping, processing, and quality assurance robotics are increasingly becoming standard equipment for most retailers and logistics firms. Since we now expect our shipments to arrive at lightning speed, logistics firms use robotics in warehouses and on the road to help improve time efficiency.

###### **Home** {#home}
Robots can also be seen in our homes, assisting with our duties, reminding us of our responsibilities, and even entertaining our children. A well-known example of this is the vacuum cleaner. It has progressed to the point that it can do everything from mowing the grass to washing pools on its own.

###### **Travel** {#travel} 
Self-driving vehicles are no longer an imagination. Self-driving cars are taking the world by surprise, thanks to a combination of computer analysis and robotics. Companies are now designing self-driving cars that do not require humans to operate.

###### **Healthcare** {#healthcare} 
Robots have made a huge progress in the medical industry. These mechanical inventions are used in almost every healthcare industry, from robot-assisted surgery to physical therapy bots that assist humans in recovering from injuries.
