    <h1>Camera Drone Kit</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of the module is to be able to understand and build the Camera Drone for Filmmaking which would be used by
        the hobbyist to capture aerial photographs and videos with the use of an RC transmitter (controller). The user can
        manipulate and control the drone at which angle they want with the use of the controller.
